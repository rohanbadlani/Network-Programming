1. RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:
./a.out <server_name> <server_port> <N> <req_per_con> <file_to_req>\nThe value of N must be less than 1000;

2. GLOBAL ARRAY:
The array is of size 1000. So pls use the number of threads(N) as <1000.

3. N Threads created, All of them detached.

4. Each is passed the server_name, file_to_req, req_to_con parameters from parent thread.

5. Each of them makes req_to_con number of connections, gets response time in microsec, takes avg and stores in global array.

6. GLOBAL ARRAY IS SHARED BETWEEN THREADS. SO MUTEX (write_mutex) used to ensure consistency.

7. Parent Thread in the meanwhile joins all the threads(thus waits for others to finish) and then finds the avg of the GLOBAL ARRAY to find FINAL_AVG_RESPONSE_TIME.
