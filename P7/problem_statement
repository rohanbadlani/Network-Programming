1. This program takes filename on the command line. 
2. This program creates 4 children. It opens the filename and passes its fd to all children using ancillary data and unix domain sockets. Through normal data, it sends the range of bytes in the file that child should process and display. 
3. Each child reads a character from file in the range specified by parent and it converts it into uppercase. It prints its pid and the converted char on the screen. printf("%d : %c\n", getpid(), c);
