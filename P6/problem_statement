VERIFYING WEBPAGES (HTTP GET REQUEST)

1. The verifyWebpages.c is a program that uses file webpages.txt for urls.
2. Retrieve the IP ADDRESS (IPv4 or IPv6) corresponding to the url specified. 
3. If found, i.e Domain Exists.
	a. Connect to the webserver requested on Port 80.
	b. If the server serves at port 80
		It sends a HTTP GET Request for the Page requested to verify of page exists.
	   If it doesn't, continue to next URL.
	
4. If not found: Continue to next URL.

I'll be extending this so that you can download all the links in the webpages.txt. (Something like wget)
