Process Pipes:

P1->C1->C2->C3->C4->C5->P1 (P1 print output)

1. P1 is the parent and it creates 5 children C1...C5. Note that all children are siblings. 
2. P1 sets up pipes in way that all children are shown in the above diagram. 
3. P1 writes a string (taken as command EOF and every child performs an operation.) Every child operation for each child is 

	a. C1: lower to upper case
	b. C2: remove first char
	c. C3: remove last char
	d. C4: remove first char
	e. C5: remove last char

4. Every child prints its name.
5. Final output is printed by parent.
